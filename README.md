# App Behaviour Analysis
This repo consists of the App Behaviour Analysis Case Study from the course, Machine Learning Practical: 6 Real-World Applications.

## Problem 
To predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership of the Application involved, with the help of various features provided for each user, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to convert those users to Paid Users.

## Model Used
The case study utilises Logistic Regression Model from the Scikit Learn Library, which is evaluated using K-Fold Cross Validation & Grid Search


## Visualisation of the data
